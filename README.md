# Module 11: Express.js Note Taker 

## Description 
The challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. For this challenge, my job was to build the back end, connect the given front end, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
