# Module 11: Express.js Note Taker 

## Description 
The challenge was to create the backend framework for an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. There is an added functionality to delete notes as well. This application is deployed using heroku at https://notetaker-zue.herokuapp.com/notes.
